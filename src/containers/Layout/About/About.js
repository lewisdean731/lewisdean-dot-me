            Originally from Cornwall, I moved to Bournemouth to study Software
            Engineering in 2017. I'm currently working as part of an agile
            development team at UKCloud for my industrial placement year, and
            thoroughly enjoying it! I am passionate about the work I do, as well
            as the technologies we all use to drive change in the industry.

            Through university, work, and personal development time I have
            gained experience using a variety of different languages, tools and
            technologies, as varied as TypeScript and React to Bash / Shell
            scripting with Jenkins pipelines and Red Hat SSO. I also have
            experience with the atlassian suite of tools (Bitbucket, Bamboo,
            Confluence, and Jira).
