        description="Originally conceived as locomotive-hauled coaching stock,
        the first coaches built were for the prototype HST in 1972. Production
        coaches entered service between 1975 and 1988, and multiple-unit
        esigns based on the Mark 3 bodyshell continued to be built until the
        early 1990s. Most of the surviving fleet of the Mark 3 and its
        derivatives are still in revenue service on the British railway
        network in 2020."
