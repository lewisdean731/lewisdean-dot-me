        <p className='mt-2'>
          I am a hardworking and determined individual, who is good at problem
          solving and always does their best to complete the given task. I have
          worked at Raytheon UK for the last 3 years and developed a wide range
          of skills both technically and socially. I work well with colleagues,
          both as a team member or team leader, inside and out of the office. In
          my spare time I have fun applying my skills in asset development to
          create 3D models, regularly compete in my local 5-a-side football
          league, and I am currently learning the Unity Engine.
